Hi Sam,

I was looking through some old notes and found a reminder to send
you the documentation on my TAPECOPY program.  I thought I had,
but it looks like it didn't make it to file 174 on the CBT tape,
so here it is (again?).

Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to make any changes to the
program.

Best,
  Aron
