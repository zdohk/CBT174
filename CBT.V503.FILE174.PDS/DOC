                TAPECOPY PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION             MARCH 1976
                -------- ------- -------------  UPDATED SEPTEMBER 1979

     THIS DOCUMENTATION DESCRIBES THE NEW VERSION OF TAPECOPY
DATED MARCH 1976.  THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THIS VERSION ARE DETAILED
AT THE END, UNDER "NEW FEATURES OF THIS VERSION."

     TAPECOPY IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW A USER TO EASILY COPY A SINGLE
TAPE TO ANOTHER TAPE, REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY FILES ARE ON THE TAPE,
WITH A MINIMUM OF JCL.

                   DD CARDS REQUIRED
                   -- ----- --------

     THE FOLLOWING DD CARDS ARE REQUIRED:
         SYSPRINT - FOR INFORMATIONAL AND ERROR MESSAGES.
                    USUALLY DEFINED AS SYSOUT=A.
         TAPE1    - DEFINES THE INPUT TAPE.  SEE "TAPE DD PARAMETERS."
         TAPE2    - DEFINES THE OUTPUT TAPE.  SEE "TAPE DD PARAMTERS."

         NOTE: IF YOU WISH YOU MAY USE DD CARDS WITH DDNAMES OF
               "SYSUT1" AND "SYSUT2" IN PLACE OF "TAPE1" AND "TAPE2."
               THIS IS FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER UTILITIES.

         IF THE INPUT DD DOES NOT DEFINE A TAPE, IT WILL BE TREATED AS
              A SINGLE FILE WITH NO LABEL PROCESSING.  YOU MAY USE THIS
              (BY SPECIFYING DD DUMMY) TO RELABEL THE OUTPUT TAPE; SEE
              "LABEL SPECIFICATION" BELOW.
         IF THE OUTPUT DD DOES NOT DEFINE A TAPE, NO OUTPUT WILL BE
              WRITTEN.  YOU MAY USE THIS (BY SPECIFYING DD DUMMY) TO
              FIND OUT WHAT IS ON YOUR INPUT TAPE.

                TAPE DD PARAMETERS
                ---- -- ----------

      LABEL=    OPTIONAL. SEE "LABEL SPECIFICATION."
      UNIT=     REQUIRED.
      VOL=SER=  REQUIRED. SEE "LABEL SPECIFICATION."

                DCB SUBPARAMETERS

      BLKSIZE=  OPTIONAL. FOR INPUT, SEE "BUFFER ALLOCATION."
                          FOR OUTPUT, SEE "HEADER LABEL CREATION."
      BUFNO=    OPTIONAL (INPUT ONLY). SEE "BUFFER ALLOCATION."
      DEN=      FOR 7-TRACK TAPES, SEE "7-TRACK TAPES."
                FOR 9-TRACK TAPES, REQUIRED ONLY FOR OUTPUT TO THE
                 FIRST FILE ON THE TAPE AT OTHER THAN THE DEFAULT
                 DENSITY FOR THE OUTPUT TAPE DRIVE; IGNORED FOR
                 SUBSEQUENT OUTPUT FILES OR ON INPUT.
      EROPT=    OPTIONAL (INPUT ONLY). SEE "I/O ERROR PROCESSING."
      LIMCT=    OPTIONAL (INPUT ONLY). SEE "END-OF-TAPE DETERMINATION."
      LRECL=    OPTIONAL (OUTPUT ONLY). SEE "HEADER LABEL CREATION."
      OPTCD=Z   OPTIONAL (INPUT ONLY). SEE "I/O ERROR PROCESSING."
      RECFM=    OPTIONAL (OUTPUT ONLY). SEE "HEADER LABEL CREATION."
      TRTCH=    SEE "7-TRACK TAPES."

                   LABEL SPECIFICATION AND THE PARM FIELD
                   ----- ------------- --- --- ---- -----

     THE DD CARD LABEL= TYPE DESCRIBES THE CURRENT LABEL TYPE
FOR THE INPUT AND OUTPUT TAPES.  THE FOLLOWING TYPES MAY BE
SPECIFIED:
         SL  - THE TAPE CONTAINS IBM OS (OR DOS) STANDARD LABELS.
               THIS IS THE DEFAULT VALUE SET BY OS IF YOU DO NOT
                SPECIFY ANY LABEL TYPE.
         NL  - THE TAPE DOES NOT CONTAIN IBM OS STANDARD LABELS.
         LTM - THE TAPE DOES NOT CONTAIN IBM OS STANDARD LABELS AND
                MAY START WITH A TAPE MARK.  IF IT DOES, THE TAPE
                MARK IS SKIPPED OVER; IF NOT, THE PROCESSING IS THE
                SAME AS FOR NL.
         BLP - NO CHECKING OF LABELS IS DONE.  IF THE TAPE DOES IN
                FACT HAVE LABELS, THEY ARE TREATED AS DATA FILES.

     THE EXEC CARD PARM= FIELD IS OPTIONAL AND HAS THREE SUBFIELDS,
SEPARATED BY COMMAS.  THEY MAY BE USED AS FOLLOWS:
     IF THE INSTALLATION STANDARDS DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPECIFY THE
         ACTUAL STANDARD LABEL OF THE INPUT TAPE AS THE VOL=SER= ON THE
         INPUT DD CARD, SPECIFY THE INSTALLATION EXTERNAL LABEL ON THE
         DD CARD AND LABEL=(,BLP); SPECIFY THE ACTUAL VOLUME SERIAL THAT
         APPEARS IN THE STANDARD LABEL AS THE FIRST PARAMETER.  THE
         ACTUAL VOLUME SERIAL WILL THEN BE VERIFIED BY TAPECOPY, AND THE
         INPUT TAPE TREATED AS STANDARD-LABELLED.  THIS OPTION MAY BE
         USED ONLY FOR THE INPUT TAPE.  IF THIS PARAMETER IS NOT USED
         BUT YOU WISH TO SPECIFY THE SECOND EXEC CARD PARAMETER, USE A
         COMMA TO INDICATE THE OMISSION.
     IF YOU WISH TO LABEL THE OUTPUT TAPE (IF IT IS NOT LABELLED),
         OR CHANGE THE VOLUME SERIAL (IF IT IS), SPECIFY THE CURRENT
         VOLUME SERIAL AND LABEL TYPE IN THE OUTPUT DD CARD, AND THE NEW
         VOLUME SERIAL AS THE SECOND EXEC CARD PARAMETER.  THE CURRENT
         LABEL TYPE AND VOLUME SERIAL, AS SPECIFIED IN THE DD CARD,
         WILL BE VERIFIED, AND A NEW VOLUME LABEL WITH THE NEW VOLUME
         SERIAL WILL BE WRITTEN.
         THE THIRD PARAMETER MAY BE USED TO SPECIFY THE OWNER
         INFORMATION (UP TO 10 CHARACTERS) IF THE SECOND PARAMETER IS
         SPECIFIED.  IF THE SECOND PARAMETER IS NOT SPECIFIED, THE THIRD
         ONE IS IGNORED.  IF THE NEW OWNER INFORMATION IS NOT SPECIFIED,
         IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE OLD VOLUME LABEL, IF THE TAPE HAD
         STANDARD LABELS; OTHERWISE FROM THE INPUT TAPE VOLUME LABEL, IF
         IT IS LABELLED.

     YOU MAY START THE TAPE COPY AT OTHER THAN THE BEGINNING OF THE
INPUT OR OUTPUT TAPES.  SPECIFY THE FILE NUMBER AT WHICH YOU WANT
TO BEGIN IN THE LABEL= DD PARAMETER, IN THE FILE SEQUENCE SUBPARAMETER.

     IF YOUR INPUT TAPE IS AN IBM PID TAPE, YOU MAY SPECIFY
"PID" AS THE FIRST EXEC CARD PARAMETER AND LABEL=(,NL) ON THE
TAPE1 DD CARD.  IF YOU DO, THE TAPE COPY WILL STOP WHEN A FILE
CONTAINING ONLY 1 80-BYTE RECORD IS COPIED (THIS IS THE STANDARD
IBM PID TRAILER LABEL FILE).  THIS OPTION IS PROVIDED BECAUSE
ONCE-UPON-A-TIME PID TAPES DID NOT HAVE 2 CONSECUTIVE TAPE MARKS
AT THE END.

                   HEADER LABEL CREATION
                   ------ ----- --------

     IF THE INPUT TAPE IS NOT LABELLED AND THE OUTPUT TAPE IS,
STANDARD HEADER LABELS WILL BE CREATED.  THE DSNAMES WILL BE OF
THE FORM "FILENNNN", WHERE "NNNN" IS THE FILE NUMBER ON THE OUTPUT
TAPE.  RECFM, LRECL, AND BLKSIZE MAY BE SPECIFIED ON THE TAPE2 DD
CARD; IF THEY ARE, THE VALUES SPECIFIED WILL BE PUT IN THE LABELS
CREATED.  IF THEY ARE NOT SPECIFIED, THE FOLLOWING WILL BE SUPPLIED:
RECFM=U, LRECL=0, BLKSIZE=0.

     IF THE INPUT TAPE HAS IBM DOS STANDARD LABELS AND THE OUTPUT
TAPE IS LABELLED, RECFM, LRECL, AND BLKSIZE WILL BE PUT IN THE
OUTPUT LABELS CREATED.  THEY ARE SPECIFIED IN THE SAME MANNER AS
IF THE INPUT WERE NOT LABELLED.

                   END-OF-TAPE DETERMINATION
                   ----------- -------------

     YOU MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF FILES COPIED BY SPECIFYING AS
DCB=LIMCT= ON THE TAPE1 DD CARD THE NUMBER OF FILE YOU WANT COPIED.

     IF NO INPUT ERRORS OCCUR, THE TAPE COPY WILL TERMINATE WHEN
ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS IS SATISFIED:

     FOR LABELLED INPUT:
         THE LIMIT SPECIFIED AS DCB=LIMCT= IS SATISFIED.
         AN EOV LABEL IS FOUND.
         TWO CONSECUTIVE TAPE MARKS ARE FOUND AFTER EOF LABELS.
              (THIS IS THE NORMAL OS INDICATION OF THE END OF A
              LABELLED TAPE).

     FOR UNLABELLED INPUT:
         THE LIMIT SPECIFIED AS DCB=LIMCT= IS SATISFIED.
         TWO CONSECUTIVE TAPE MARKS ARE FOUND AFTER A FILE.
              (THIS IS THE NORMAL OS INDICATION OF THE END OF AN
              UNLABELLED TAPE).
         IF THE INPUT TAPE WAS SPECIFIED AS A PID TAPE (SEE "LABEL
              SPECIFICATION" ABOVE), WHEN A FILE CONTAINING A SINGLE
              80-BYTE RECORD IS COPIED.

     FOR PROCESSING AFTER AN INPUT ERROR OCCURS, SEE "I/O ERROR
PROCESSING" BELOW.

                   BUFFER ALLOCATION
                   ------ ----------

     THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF BUFFERS USED FOR THE INPUT AND OUTPUT
TAPES ARE DETERMINED FROM USER SPECIFICATIONS AND FROM THE INPUT
LABELS (IF THE INPUT TAPE IS LABELLED), AS FOLLOWS:

     NUMBER OF BUFFERS: THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 2.
         THIS MAY BE OVERRIDDEN WITH THE DCB=BUFNO= PARAMETER ON THE
         TAPE1 DD CARD.

     BUFFER SIZE: THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 10232.
         THIS MAY BE OVERRIDDEN BY SPECIFYING THE DCB=BLKSIZE= PARAMETER
         ON THE TAPE1 DD CARD.  IF THE INPUT TAPE IS LABELLED, THE
         BLKSIZE IN THE LABEL FOR EACH INPUT FILE WILL BE USED IF IT IS
         LARGER THAN THE VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE DD CARD (OR DEFAULTED).
         NOTE: THE BUFFER SIZE WILL ALWAYS BE 1 BYTE LARGER THAN THE
               BLKSIZE SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN DETERMINE AFTER AN INPUT
               BLOCK IS READ WHETHER IT EXCEEDS THE BLKSIZE BEING USED.

                   STORAGE REQUIRED
                   ------- --------

     THE STORAGE REQUIRED IS 18K + WHATEVER IS REQUIRED FOR BUFFERS.

     TO CALCULATE THE STORAGE REQUIRED FOR BUFFERS:
         TAKE THE BLKSIZE BEING USED. (SEE "BUFFER ALLOCATION" ABOVE.
          IF NO BLKSIZE= PARAMETER WAS SPECIFIED FOR TAPE1 AND NO
          INPUT FILES HAVE A LARGER BLKSIZE, THE DEFAULT BLKSIZE IS
          10231).
         ADD 1.
         ROUND UP TO A MULTIPLE OF 8.
         MULTIPLY BY BUFNO (DEFAULT IS 2).
         ADD 8.
         ROUND UP TO A MULTIPLE OF 2048.
         IF THE OUTPUT IS A TAPE, MULTIPLY BY 2.

     WITH THE DEFAULT OPTIONS, THE BUFFERS TAKE 40K, SO THE
PROGRAM WILL RUN IN 58K.

                   RETURN CODES
                   ------ -----

     THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RETURN CODES SET ON EXIT TO THE OPERATING
SYSTEM:

          0    THE TAPE COPY COMPLETED NORMALLY

          4    CONFLICTING OR UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS WERE SPECIFIED.
               NO TAPE PROCESSING WAS DONE.

          8    THE LABELS DO NOT MATCH WHAT WAS SPECIFIED.
               NO WRITING ON THE OUTPUT TAPE WAS DONE.

         12    AN INPUT ERROR OR LABEL ERROR OCCURRED AND THE TAPE COPY
               WAS TERMINATED.  TRAILER LABELS ON THE OUTPUT TAPE WERE
               WRITTEN (IF APPROPRIATE) SO THAT IT CAN BE PROCESSED BY
               STANDARD ACCESS METHODS.
|              THIS RETURN CODE IS ALSO ISSUED IF THE BLOCK COUNT IN
|              THE EOF1/EOV1 LABEL FOR THE INPUT TAPE DOES NOT MATCH
|              THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS READ.  PROCESSING IS NOT TERMINATED
|              FOR THIS ERROR.

         16    AN UNRECOVERABLE INPUT ERROR (A CHANNEL ERROR, FOR
               EXAMPLE) OR AN OUTPUT ERROR OCCURRED.  THE OUTPUT TAPE
               MAY NOT BE USABLE.

         20    ONE OF THE REQUIRED DD CARDS WAS MISSING.

                   I/O ERROR PROCESSING
                   --- ----- ----------

                      OUTPUT ERRORS

     OUTPUT ERRORS ARE NOT RECOVERABLE.  AN APPROPRIATE MESSAGE
IS PRINTED ON SYSPRINT (UNLESS THE ERROR OCCURRED ON SYSPRINT, IN
WHICH CASE THE MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO SYSMSG).  PROCESSING TERMINATES
IMMEDIATELY WITH A RETURN CODE OF 16.

     NOTE THAT THE OPERATING SYSTEM WILL ATTEMPT TO WRITE A TAPE
MARK TO INDICATE THE END OF THE OUTPUT FILE.  IF THE TAPE IS IN SUCH
POOR CONDITION THAT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, A SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE
OF 714-0C WILL RESULT.

                       INPUT ERRORS

     INPUT ERRORS CAUSED BY THE CHANNEL ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND ARE
TREATED THE SAME AS OUTPUT ERRORS.

     SOME OTHER INPUT ERRORS ARE TREATED AS NON-RECOVERABLE.  THE
INPUT TAPE IS NOT READ ANY FURTHER, OUTPUT TRAILER LABELS ARE WRITTEN
(IF APPROPRIATE), AND PROCESSING TERMINATES.  THESE ARE:

         BUS-OUT CHECK OR COMMAND REJECT
              THESE ERRORS WILL NOT NORMALLY OCCUR.

         EQUIPMENT CHECK
              THIS MAY INDICATE THAT THE TAPE DRIVE IS BROKEN, BUT IT
              MORE USUALLY HAPPENS IF THE TAPE RUNS OFF THE END OF THE
              REEL OR THE OPERATOR PRESSES THE "RESET" BUTTON.

         NOT-CAPABLE
              THIS OCCURS ON A 9-TRACK TAPE DRIVE WHEN IT DETERMINES
              THAT THE TAPE IS WRITTEN AT A DENSITY THAT THE TAPE DRIVE
              IS NOT CAPABLE OF READING.

     THE USER MAY SPECIFY THE DESIRED ACTION IN CASE OF A MORE USUAL
ERROR (SUCH AS A DATA CHECK) VIA THE DCB=EROPT= PARAMETER IN THE
DD CARD FOR TAPE1.  THE FOLLOWING MAY BE SPECIFIED:

     DCB=EROPT=ABE  TREAT THE ERROR AS UNRECOVERABLE AND TERMINATE
                    PROCESSING.

     DCB=EROPT=SKP  SKIP THE BAD BLOCK.

     DCB=EROPT=ACC  COPY WHATEVER WAS READ.

     IF DCB=EROPT= IS NOT SPECIFIED, WHATEVER WAS READ WILL BE COPIED,
BUT PROCESSING WILL TERMINATE AFTER 50 ERRORS OCCUR ON A TAPE.

     IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR TAPE HAS A LOT OF ERRORS ON IT, YOU CAN
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT OS SPENDS IN ERROR RECOVERY AND
ELIMINATE THE ERROR MESSAGES TO THE OPERATOR BY SPECIFIYING
DCB=OPTCD=Z ON THE INPUT DD CARD.

     APPROPRIATE MESSAGES WILL BE WRITTEN WHENEVER ANY ERROR OCCURS.

                   7-TRACK TAPES
                   ------- -----

                      DENSITY

     TO BE PROCESSED BY TAPECOPY, 7-TRACK TAPES MUST HAVE ALL FILES
THAT WILL BE READ AT THE SAME DENSITY.  IF THE DENSITY IS OTHER
THAN 800BPI, IT MUST BE SPECIFIED IN THE DCB=DEN= PARAMETER ON THE
DD CARD.  THIS APPLIED TO BOTH THE INPUT AND OUTPUT TAPES.

            RECORDING TECHNIQUE (TRTCH)

     IF THE INPUT TAPE IS LABELLED, THE TRTCH FROM EACH HEADER
LABEL WILL BE USED TO PROCESS THAT FILE.  (LABELS ARE ALWAYS
WRITTEN WITH TRTCH=ET).
     IF THE INPUT AND OUTPUT ARE BOTH LABELLED AND TRTCH IS NOT
SPECIFIED FOR THE OUTPUT TAPE, EACH FILE WILL BE COPIED WITH THE
SAME TRTCH AS IT IS WRITTEN WITH ON THE INPUT TAPE.
     IN ALL OTHER CASES, IF THE SYSTEM DEFAULT IS NOT CORRECT,
DCB=TRTCH= MUST BE SPECIFIED FOR THE INPUT OR OUTPUT TAPES.

                   FACILITIES NOT SUPPORTED
                   ---------- --- ---------

     THE FOLLOWING FEATURES OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM ARE NOT
SUPPORTED BY TAPECOPY.  IF THEY ARE SPECIFIED, AN ERROR MESSAGE
WILL BE WRITTEN AND NO PROCESSING WILL BE DONE.

         OPTCD=C   IF THIS WERE USED, TAPECOPY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
                   DETERMINE HOW LONG EACH BLOCK IT READ WAS.

         OPTCD=Q OR LABEL=(,AL)  TAPECOPY DOES NOT SUPPORT ASCII LABELS.

         LABEL=(,NSL)  TAPECOPY DOES NOT SUPPORT NON-STANDARD LABELS.
                   AN EXACT COPY OF THE TAPE MAY BE MADE BY SPECIFYING
                   LABEL=(,BLP) FOR THE INPUT AND OUTPUT TAPES.

         MULTI-VOLUME DATASETS  TAPECOPY ONLY PROCESSES SINGLE TAPES.

         REBLOCKING  TAPECOPY DOES NOT PROVIDE A MEANS TO REBLOCK DATA.

     IF YOU NEED ANY OF THESE FEATURES, USE A DATASET-ORIENTED
UTILITY LIKE IEBGENER.

                   NEW FEATURES OF THIS VERSION
                   --- -------- -- ---- -------

     THE FOLLOWING FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED IN THE VERSION OF
TAPECOPY DATED MARCH 1976.  THEY ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

     DD CARD PARAMETERS:  DCB=EROPT=; DCB=LIMCT=; LABEL=(,LTM).

     HEADER LABEL CREATION FOR DOS LABELLED TAPES.

     ENHANCED MESSAGES.  ENHANCED ERROR RECOVERY.

     INPUT STANDARD LABEL VALIDATION.  EOV LABEL DETECTION.

     6250BPI DENSITY SUPPORT.  DENSITY ALWAYS PLACED IN OUTPUT LABEL.

|    INPUT TAPE EOF1/EOV1 BLOCK COUNT NOW CHECKED.
